# CollegeChat
CollegeChat is a ChatGPt-based guide for college applications.

The first application is SAT feedback. As an example, here is a file containing all the questions, answers, and grading of a complete reading and writing section of a sample Bluebook test [(link)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BZA7WTYUaiYBAMC40IwTcYDyNmtJSEHv/view?usp=sharing).

This took about ten minutes to put into a Google Doc and save as a PDF.

This was then uploaded to chat.com, and chat.com was given the following prompt:

> Analyze this SAT reading and writing test. Explain what the student's weak areas are.


Chat.com will give a summary of the student's performance, as well as an in-depth analysis with respect to weak areas in 
- Reading - Comprehension & Analysis
- Writing & Language - Grammar & Expression

Chat.com will also give a Skill Pattern Summary, and also Recommendations.

Finally, chat.com was given the following prompt:

> Create a personalized 4-week SAT Reading and Writing study plan for the student

(There are other options for the prompt, such as a 2-week plan or a plan for a particular topic)
